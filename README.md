## ðŸ“‘ About the Project
A simple project made in Python to practice concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and **loops**.

The program simulates a basic stock management system, allowing:

- Add products to stock
- Remove products from stock (with quantity check)
- View current stock
- Exit the program

## ðŸš€ Features
- Add items to stock
- Remove items from stock with quantity verification
- Display current stock
- Interactive menu running in a loop until the user chooses to exit

## ðŸ§  Concepts Applied
- Creating classes and methods in Python
- Managing attributes with `self`
- Loops (`while`)
- Conditionals (`if / else`)
- User input with `input`
- Basic error handling with `try / except`
